# LeetCode Solutions by Lekha

This repository contains my Python solutions to various LeetCode problems.  
Each file is named after the problem it solves, and solutions are grouped by topic or difficulty (in progress).

## 📂 Structure

Right now, the problems are uploaded as individual `.py` files. I plan to organize them by:
- Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard), or
- Topic (DP, Arrays, Strings, etc.)
